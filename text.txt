Features that can be removed from missing values 

Alley, MasVnrType, FireplaceQu, PoolQC, Fence, MiscFeature

However, lets have a look at this data before we remove it. All of the features do seem to have some affect on the house price but there just is not enough data in these columns and so filling the values with something would risk making the model less accurate
